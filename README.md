    'your_category': ['skill1', 'skill2', 'skill3'],
    # ... existing categories
}
```

### Modifying Cover Letter Templates
Edit the `templates` dictionary in `cover_letter_generator.py`:

```python
self.templates = {
    'opening': [
        "Your custom opening template {position} at {company}...",
        # ... more templates
    ],
    # ... other sections
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NLTK Data Not Found**
   - The application automatically downloads required NLTK data
   - If issues persist, manually download:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

2. **File Upload Errors**
   - Ensure file is in supported format (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT)
   - Check file size (recommended < 10MB)
   - Verify file is not corrupted

3. **Analysis Errors**
   - Ensure job description is not empty
   - Check that resume file was uploaded successfully
   - Verify resume contains readable text

### Performance Tips
- For large job descriptions, consider breaking them into smaller sections
- Resume files should be text-based for best results
- Close other applications to free up memory if processing is slow
